# OpenScan - 3D Scanner

OpenScan is a modular concept, which can be used to build your photogrammetry based 3D scanner. You can simply use the individual modules and adjust it to your needs
(i.e. firmware, 3d printed design, PCB, photogrammetry cloud processing ...). The center piece is a Raspberry Pi driven camera/motor controller, which can be used to drive various photogrammetry rigs. 

The project is based on the contribution of many great and open-minded people by doing tutorials on YouTube, comments on Reddit, publications on GitHub and many other places. Without all those voluntary contributors, this project would not be possible at all. There is a little [TODO guideline](TODO) on how you can join the project and make it even greater :)

## Documentation - Set-up and use your scanner

Use the navigation bar on this site or the following links to get your scanner up and running:

- [Soldering](TODO)
- [Building the OpenScan Classic](TODO)
- [Building the OpenScan Mini](TODO) 
- [Firmware - Setup](TODO)
- [Firmware - First start, tips&tricks](TODO)
- [Photogrammetry](TODO)

## Bugs & Feature requests 

If you like the project and want to help to make it even better, please consider supporting it in any of the following ways:

- **share the project** and scanning results with the world - the more people join, the faster the project will improve
- **report a bug** or create a **feature request** - this can be a minor typo in the firmware or a major revision. Don't be afraid, if you have no programming background, [this guide]() has you covered.
- improve the **design or electronics** 
- help with the **documentation**
- create **video tutorials** or any other **educational resources**
