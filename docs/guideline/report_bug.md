# How to create an issue on GitHub

Did you find an annoying bug or have a great idea on how to improve OpenScan. No matter if it is just a misaligned text in the firmware or a revolutionary new scanner design that you want to share. **You can simply create an issue in the according repository (see below).**

For the following steps a free GitHub account is needed:

## Navigate to the right repository

Choose the topic and open it in a new tab:

* [Documentation](https://github.com/OpenScan-org/OpenScan-Doku/)
* [Firmware](https://github.com/OpenScan-org/OpenScan2)
* [CAD](https://github.com/OpenScan-org/OpenScan-Design)
* [PCB](https://github.com/OpenScan-org/OpenScan-PCB)
* [OpenScanCloud](https://github.com/OpenScan-org/OpenScanCloud)

- Navigate to Issues (1)
- Use the search/filter to check if there is already a solution to the problem (e.g. "cloud") (2)
- Please take some time to read the existing issues/solutions carefully
- If needed, continue to create a new issue (3)

## Create a new issue

**TODO ADD SCREENSHOT**

- Choose one of the existing templates (e.g. bug report, feature request, design idea ...)
- Use the given structure as much as possible (but feel free to deviate from it as needed). 
- You can add photos/screenshots and even videos. Try to be as specific as possible.
- Feel free to add labels.
- Submit the issue
- Note, that it does not really help, if the issue is published on other plattforms, as all development is coordinated here on Github.
- You will be notified by mail as soon as the status of the issue changes (e.g. someone needs more details)
- Inactive issues will be closed after 30 days

**A final, but very important note: (Unfortunately) there is no payed developer team behind this project (yet ;) and it is maintained by a group of enthusiasts in their free time. So please bare this in mind, when submitting any kind of issue.**
